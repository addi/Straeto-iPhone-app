==================

A strætó iPhone app

Installing
----------

This project uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) so setting up the dependencies is a breeze

    gem install cocoapods
    pod install

Try to add all new dependencies using CocoaPods!

Using CocoaPods also means that we want to use the xcworkspace instead of the xcodeproj
for development.

When updating it seems to work better to use

    pod update

Check regularly for outdated dependancies

    pod outdated

and don't forget to update cocoapods!

    gem update cocoapods
